# Skill & Attribute System

This game uses a **use-based skill progression system** inspired by:
- Anarchy Online
- Star Wars Galaxies (Pre-CU)
- Xsyon
- Entropia Universe

Characters improve skills by **using them**.  
Long-term character identity is defined by **base attributes**.  
Skills receive passive bonuses from attributes via a **trickle-down system**.

---

## Core Rules

- Skills increase through use
- Attributes increase slowly
- Attributes enhance skills but never replace skill investment
- No rigid class system
- Hybrid and specialist builds are supported

---

## Base Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Strength | Raw physical power |
| Stamina | Endurance, health, resistance |
| Agility | Speed, balance, coordination |
| Dexterity | Precision and fine motor control |
| Intelligence | Logic, learning, analysis |
| Wisdom | Perception, intuition, experience |
| Charisma | Presence, leadership, influence |
| Willpower | Mental resilience and focus |

---

## Trickle-Down Attribute System

Each skill is affected by two attributes:

- **Primary Attribute** (~70% contribution)
- **Secondary Attribute** (~40% contribution)

Attributes provide a passive bonus to skill effectiveness.

### Conceptual Formula

Effective Skill =
Base Skill  
+ (Primary Attribute × 0.7 × Attribute Factor)  
+ (Secondary Attribute × 0.4 × Attribute Factor)

The Attribute Factor is intentionally small to ensure:
- Skill use remains dominant
- Attributes shape characters over the long term
