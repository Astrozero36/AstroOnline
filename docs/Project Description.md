- we are building an MMORPG with an authoritative server (written in Visual C# .NET) and client (written in Unity3D)

- the server will be a created in visual studio c# and run on my local windows machine for now.

- the client is in 3D (done in unity) and is to run on windows

- The MMORPG will be called Astro Online (after me, it's creator)

- we will code our UI purely in C# using Unity's UI Toolkit

- the MMORPG will have a character creator where you can customize the appearance of your character

- there will be no 'classes' each character will be able to do anything as long as they have the skills

- characters earn skills by doing things that use that skill (eg. cooking food will raise cooking skill)

- the game will have crafting which is based loosely and star wars galaxies and also on an MMORPG called Xsyon
